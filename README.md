# T3D is the first thermal-aware tensor framework for 3D-stacked SRAM architectures, leveraging tensor dataflow characteristics to enhance thermal performance.
# The related work has been submitted to a journal, and the corresponding code is currently under software copyright registration, with plans for open-source release in the near future.
